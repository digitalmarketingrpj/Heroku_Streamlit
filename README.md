# Heroku_Streamlit
Faiss is a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. It contains algorithms that search in sets of vectors of any size, up to ones that possibly do not fit in RAM.The output from FAISS is an integer matrix that has index of the most similar vectors.
This folder contains:
-> All the images that are used for similarity search using the FAISS model
-> Output of FAISS model in faiss.csv
-> The application file app.py is built to fetch similar images using STREAMLIT
-> PROCfile, requirements.txt are supporting files to host the application on Heroku.
